OS Bench
========

This is a naive attempt to create a package manager for Unix-like systems.
It is inspired by [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew), but is written
in a language for a human being.

Right now, it is no more than a prototype.

Plans
-----

* To make it available under most Linuxes, BSDs and OSXes.
* Allow easy usage of many custom schema repositories.
* Conquer the World! Mu-ha-ha!!!

Development
